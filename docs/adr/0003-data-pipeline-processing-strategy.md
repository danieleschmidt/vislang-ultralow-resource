# ADR-0003: Data Pipeline Processing Strategy

Date: 2025-01-01
Status: Accepted

## Context

Humanitarian documents come from diverse sources with varying formats, languages, and quality levels. The pipeline must handle large volumes of documents while maintaining data quality and ensuring privacy protection.

## Decision

We will implement a staged processing pipeline:

1. **Source Adaptation Layer** - Pluggable adapters for different data sources
2. **Content Extraction** - PDF parsing, web scraping, and API integration
3. **Quality Assessment** - Automated and human-in-the-loop validation
4. **Cross-lingual Alignment** - English-to-target language instruction generation
5. **Dataset Assembly** - Format conversion and standardization

Processing will be asynchronous with checkpointing for fault tolerance.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Scalable processing of large document collections
- Robust error handling and recovery
- High data quality through multi-stage validation
- Privacy protection through anonymization
- Extensible architecture for new data sources

**Negative:**
- Complex system with multiple failure points
- Higher resource requirements for quality control
- Longer processing times due to validation steps
- Storage overhead for intermediate results

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Simple batch processing** - Rejected due to poor error recovery
2. **Streaming pipeline** - Rejected due to quality control requirements
3. **Manual processing** - Rejected due to scalability limitations
4. **Cloud-based pipeline** - Rejected due to data privacy concerns
