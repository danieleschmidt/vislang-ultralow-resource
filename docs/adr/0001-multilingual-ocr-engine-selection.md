# ADR-0001: Multilingual OCR Engine Selection

Date: 2025-01-01
Status: Accepted

## Context

The VisLang-UltraLow-Resource project requires robust OCR capabilities for extracting text from humanitarian documents containing diverse languages and scripts. Many target languages have limited digital representation and non-Latin scripts, requiring specialized OCR engines.

## Decision

We will implement a multi-engine OCR approach using:

1. **Tesseract 5.x** - Primary engine for established language support
2. **EasyOCR** - Neural-based engine for better accuracy on complex layouts
3. **PaddleOCR** - Advanced engine with superior layout analysis

The system will use confidence scoring and consensus mechanisms to select the best OCR result for each text region.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Higher accuracy through engine consensus
- Better coverage of ultra-low-resource languages
- Robust handling of complex document layouts
- Fallback mechanisms for engine failures

**Negative:**
- Increased computational overhead
- Higher memory requirements
- More complex dependency management
- Longer processing times

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Single Engine (Tesseract only)** - Rejected due to limited accuracy on complex layouts
2. **Cloud OCR APIs** - Rejected due to privacy concerns with humanitarian data
3. **Custom Neural OCR** - Rejected due to insufficient training data for target languages
