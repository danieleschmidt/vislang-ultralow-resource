## Runbook Structure

Each runbook follows this standard structure:

1. **Summary** - Brief description of the issue
2. **Severity** - Impact level and urgency
3. **Symptoms** - How to identify the problem
4. **Investigation Steps** - How to diagnose the issue
5. **Resolution Steps** - How to fix the problem
6. **Prevention** - How to avoid the issue in future
7. **Escalation** - When and how to escalate

## General Troubleshooting Principles

### 1. Assess the Situation
- Check monitoring dashboards for overall system health
- Identify affected components and user impact
- Determine if this is a widespread or isolated issue

### 2. Gather Information
- Check recent deployments or configuration changes
- Review error logs and metrics
- Identify patterns in the data (time-based, user-based, etc.)

### 3. Quick Fixes First
- Apply immediate mitigation if available
- Scale resources if it's a capacity issue
- Restart services if it's a transient problem

### 4. Root Cause Analysis
- Once the immediate issue is resolved, investigate the root cause
- Document findings and lessons learned
- Update runbooks and monitoring as needed

## Escalation Matrix

| Severity | Response Time | Escalation Path |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Critical | 15 minutes | On-call â†’ Team Lead â†’ Engineering Manager |
| High | 1 hour | On-call â†’ Team Lead |
| Medium | 4 hours | On-call â†’ Next business day |
| Low | 24 hours | Create ticket for next sprint |
