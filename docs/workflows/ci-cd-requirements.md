# GitHub Actions CI/CD Requirements

This document outlines the required GitHub Actions workflows for the VisLang-UltraLow-Resource project.

## Required Workflows

### 1. Main CI Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

**Triggers**: Push to main, pull requests
**Python Versions**: 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
**OS Matrix**: ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest

**Steps Required**:
- Checkout code
- Set up Python with matrix versions
- Install dependencies with pip cache
- Run pre-commit hooks (black, isort, flake8, mypy)
- Run tests with pytest and coverage
- Upload coverage to CodeCov
- Security scanning with bandit and safety
- Detect secrets scanning
- Build package and test installation

**Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 80% (configured in pyproject.toml)

### 2. Security Scanning (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)

**Triggers**: Push to main, pull requests, scheduled weekly
**Security Tools Required**:
- Bandit for Python security issues
- Safety for known vulnerabilities  
- Snyk for dependency scanning
- CodeQL for semantic analysis
- Detect-secrets for credential scanning
- SBOM generation with cyclonedx-python

**Artifact Storage**: Security reports in GitHub Security tab

### 3. Release Automation (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)

**Triggers**: Git tag push (v*)
**Steps Required**:
- Full CI pipeline validation
- Build source and wheel distributions
- Generate SBOM and sign artifacts
- Create GitHub release with changelog
- Publish to PyPI (with manual approval)
- Update documentation
- Notify stakeholders

### 4. Dependency Updates (`.github/workflows/dependencies.yml`)

**Triggers**: Scheduled weekly, manual dispatch
**Tools**: Dependabot configuration + custom scripts
**Actions**:
- Check for outdated dependencies
- Create PRs for security updates (auto-merge)
- Create PRs for minor updates (review required)
- Test compatibility before merging
- Update security baseline after changes

### 5. Documentation (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`)

**Triggers**: Push to main, documentation changes
**Requirements**:
- Auto-generate API docs from docstrings
- Build and deploy documentation site
- Validate example code in documentation
- Check for broken links
- Update README badges

## Environment Requirements

### Secrets Configuration
```yaml
# Required repository secrets
PYPI_API_TOKEN: # For package publishing
CODECOV_TOKEN: # For coverage reporting  
SNYK_TOKEN: # For security scanning
SLACK_WEBHOOK: # For notifications (optional)
```

### Environment Variables
```yaml
PYTHON_VERSION: "3.11" # Default Python version
MIN_COVERAGE: 80 # Minimum test coverage
SECURITY_SEVERITY: "high" # Minimum security issue severity
```

## Workflow Integration Points

### Pre-commit Integration
- All formatting/linting runs in CI must match pre-commit
- Pre-commit hooks should be cached and fast
- Failures should provide clear remediation steps

### Quality Gates
- Tests must pass with 80%+ coverage
- Security scans must show no high/critical issues
- Code quality metrics must meet thresholds
- Documentation must build successfully

### Artifact Management
- Test results stored as GitHub artifacts
- Security reports uploaded to GitHub Security
- Coverage reports sent to CodeCov
- Build artifacts cached between runs

### Notification Strategy
- Failed main branch builds notify maintainers
- Security issues create GitHub Issues automatically
- Release success/failure notifications to team
- Weekly dependency update summaries

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- pip dependencies cached by requirements hash
- Pre-commit environments cached
- Docker layers cached for consistent environments
- Test results cached for unchanged code

### Parallel Execution
- Matrix builds run in parallel
- Independent test suites parallelized
- Security scans run concurrent with tests
- Documentation builds separately

### Resource Management
- GPU runners for ML model tests (if needed)
- Appropriate timeouts for all jobs
- Resource cleanup after workflow completion
- Cost optimization through efficient job scheduling

## Compliance and Governance

### Audit Requirements
- All workflow runs logged and retained
- Security scan results archived
- Dependency changes tracked in audit log
- Release artifacts signed and verified

### Access Control
- Workflow permissions follow least-privilege
- Sensitive operations require manual approval
- Branch protection rules enforced
- Required status checks for merging

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Workflow success/failure rates tracked
- Performance metrics monitored
- Security posture dashboard updated
- Dependency update compliance measured

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: Main CI pipeline with testing and security
2. **Medium Priority**: Release automation and dependency management  
3. **Low Priority**: Advanced monitoring and documentation automation

## Rollback Procedures

### Failed Deployment Recovery
1. Revert problematic changes
2. Re-run full test suite
3. Verify security scans pass
4. Redeploy with rollback tag

### Workflow Failure Investigation
1. Check workflow logs for errors
2. Verify environment configuration
3. Test locally to reproduce issues
4. Update workflow configuration if needed

*Note: These workflows cannot be automatically created due to security restrictions. They must be manually implemented by repository maintainers following these specifications.*
