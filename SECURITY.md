# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The VisLang-UltraLow-Resource project takes security seriously, especially given our humanitarian focus and handling of potentially sensitive data.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing the maintainers directly. Include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested mitigation strategies

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week  
- **Resolution Timeline**: Communicated after assessment
- **Public Disclosure**: Only after fix is deployed

## Security Considerations

### Data Handling
- **Personal Information**: Never log or store personal data from humanitarian reports
- **Source Attribution**: Protect organizational and individual data sources
- **Model Outputs**: Ensure generated content doesn't expose training data

### API Security
- **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication for data access
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of scraping and processing endpoints
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs and uploaded content

### Model Security
- **Training Data**: Audit data sources for sensitive information
- **Model Poisoning**: Validate training data integrity
- **Adversarial Attacks**: Consider robustness against malicious inputs

### Infrastructure
- **Dependencies**: Regularly audit and update all dependencies
- **Secrets Management**: Never commit API keys or credentials
- **Access Control**: Implement least-privilege access principles
