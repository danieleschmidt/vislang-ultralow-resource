# VisLang-UltraLow-Resource Project Charter

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** VisLang-UltraLow-Resource  
**Project Code:** VLULR  
**Start Date:** January 2025  
**Project Manager:** Daniel Schmidt  
**Charter Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** January 2025  

## Executive Summary

VisLang-UltraLow-Resource aims to democratize vision-language AI capabilities for ultra-low-resource languages by creating an automated framework that transforms humanitarian documents into high-quality multimodal training datasets and enables robust model fine-tuning for underserved communities.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

1. **Digital Divide in AI:** Modern vision-language AI systems primarily serve high-resource languages, leaving billions of speakers of ultra-low-resource languages without access to multimodal AI capabilities.

2. **Data Scarcity:** Ultra-low-resource languages lack sufficient text-image paired datasets required for training effective vision-language models.

3. **Technical Barriers:** Existing tools require extensive technical expertise and computational resources, making them inaccessible to communities that need them most.

4. **Cultural Misalignment:** Generic models fail to understand cultural contexts, visual conventions, and domain-specific knowledge relevant to humanitarian and development work.

### Impact of Inaction

Without intervention, the AI capability gap will continue widening, leaving vulnerable populations unable to benefit from advances in multimodal AI that could transform healthcare, education, disaster response, and community development.
